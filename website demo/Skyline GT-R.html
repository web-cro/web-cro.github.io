    <p>The Nissan R35 GTR made its debut at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, and its launch to the Japanese market was the 6th December 2007. It was launched to the U.S.A July 07, 2008. The Nissan R35 has its engine and rear-mounted dual-clutch gearbox built by hand, limiting production to around 1000 cars a month. It also features the world’s first independent transaxle 4WD developed by Nissan.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although the R35 no longer carrys the “Skyline” badge, it has heritage in the earlier models. Just like its predecessors, the “R32-R34”, the R35 and R35 <a href="#nismo">Nismo</a> are both all-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6 cylinder engine. But thats about all they have in common, the traditional Straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT, also the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed. The R35 with the chassis code CBA-R35 is carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GTR’s. It has also retained the nickname “Godzilla”.
    </p>
    <p>      
    The first Nissan R35 concept was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001 to show how the 21st century model would look. Nissan unveiled a redesigned concept at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show, the GTR Proto, stating that the production model would be 80-90% based on this concept.
    </p>  
    <p>        
    The creators of the Gran Turismo series of racing video games, were contracted to design the multifunction display. The R35 gives ultimate performance for virtually every driving condition whether it be on the Nurburgring circuit, on snow, rain or urban streets, it is all manageable to the GTR driver through the advanced technology and driving dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
    Nissan have claimed it will reach a top speed of 195 mph “314 km/h” and that it has been tested to achieve 0-60 mph “97 km/h” times as low as 3.2 seconds. Nissan have also claimed a lap time of 7:29 sec using standard Japanese market tires, which makes the R35 currently one of the fastest production cars to lap the Nürburgring circuit. Porsche have accused Nissan of falsifying these claims, Porsche conducted their own test of the R35 GTR using no modifications and stock tires and achieved a best time of 7:54. Nissan have officially disputed Porsche’s claim in October 2008. Another independent test recorded a time of 7:50, although one key corner of the track was damp. The Nissan GTR currently holds a lap time of 1:19.7 around the Top Gear Test Track, “equal with the Ferrari F430 Scuderia”. On the Las Vegas Motor Speedway infield road course, Motor Trend were able to achieve lap times that were equal to the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano and Porsche 911 GT2 and only 3 seconds slower than the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1.

    <h2 id="nismo">GT-R NISMO</h2>
    <p>Nissan introduced a NISMO Edition GT-R for model year 2014. US price increased almost 50% to US$149,990.
    In the new model, power increases to 441 kW (600 PS; 591 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 652 N⋅m (481 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3,200-5,800 rpm. The 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) time changed to 2.5 seconds.[40] The gear-ratios did not change in the dual-clutch transmission. The fuel tank capacity is 19.5 US gal; 16.3 imp gal (74 L). Additional front and rear brake cooling ducts are added, and a full NISMO tuned suspension is installed, including a hollow 17.3 mm (0.68 in) rear stabilizer bar from the NISMO performance division.

    <p>   
    Special edition forged alloys by RAYS in 20-inch size are included. The standard GT-R's aluminium trunk lid is swapped out for a full carbon fibre panel and additional spot welds and adhesive help strengthen the chassis. A front splitter with carbon fibre air ducts up front add to the special NISMO full aerodynamic package, while a large racing style carbon wing completes the rear.  
    </p>        
    Inside, the NISMO edition has special seats with black and red color treatment made with synthetic suede. The instrument binnacle and steering wheel are also covered in synthetic suede. The Bose stereo system does not have active noise control. The gauges have some red colour treatment as well. NISMO-specific options are low-gloss matte gray paint and a full titanium exhaust with additional heatsinks. These changes, in aggregate, reduce weight by 17 kg (38 lb), which is the reason that the NISMO GT-R accelerates even faster than before.
    </p>

    At the April 2019 New York Auto Show, Nissan unveiled the 2020 model year GT-R NISMO and the 50th anniversary GT-R for the GT-R's 50th anniversary. Updates to the NISMO GT-R include a new "R mode" gear shifting setting to shift gears more quickly, new turbochargers from the GT3 race car to improve the acceleration, RAYS 20-inch wheels, GT3-inspired fender vents, lightweight carbon ceramic brakes, new re-tuned suspension and the roof, hood and fenders are made with carbon fibre to reduce the weight. Nissan says new NISMO GT-R is faster and more track focused than previous models, and the weight has been reduced by 20 kg compared to the 2017 model year NISMO GT-R
